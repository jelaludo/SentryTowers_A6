# Devlog

Authored asset changes, game integration feedback, and work still to do. Completed entries describe exports in this repository; open requests are not completed features.

## Open requests from the game developer

1. **Terraformer 3000 and HUGIN launch pad — pending.** Create game tiers targeting 8,000 triangles, 10 draws and 400 KB plain GLB or less, plus distance tiers targeting 3,000 triangles, one draw and 250 KB. Preserve current node names so `Terraforming_Cycle` and `Cargo_Recovery_Cycle` continue to bind. The existing approximately 40k-triangle game versions exceed the new target.
2. **Robotic assembly line — pending.** Apply the same landmark budgets. The developer reports the current asset at approximately 97k triangles / 7.2 MB.
3. **SH02 rocket — pending.** Add a distance tier for the landing island as seen from the map.

The game currently uses its own derived far tiers for the first request. Those are game-side derivatives, not new authored exports in this library. The game developer's original notes are retained in [ASSET-COLLABORATION.md](../docs/ASSET-COLLABORATION.md).

## 12 September 2026 / MÖRK turret cleanup and wireframe

**Completed.** Removed the intersecting turret cheek overlays from standard and low-poly tanks, including the copies in loaded containers and deployment dioramas. Added a wireframe toggle alongside neutral shading in the tank viewer. Rebuilt source files and container package; checks cover weapon clearance, animations, ammunition display, container fit and rollout.

## 12 September 2026 / KORP roof fit correction

**Completed.** Front and rear armor panels now conform to the sloping roof, and rear access hatches sit on their supporting surfaces. The shallow dorsal spine had folded side faces; its chamfers now scale to the available section height. Updated all three exports, source and package. Current budgets: detailed 5,228 triangles, game 2,472, distance 1,218; draw calls remain 50 / 16 / 1.

## 12 September 2026 / KORP heavy gunship

**Completed.** Authored through Blender MCP as a MÖRK-manufacturer aircraft. Twin forward rotary cannons pitch down 70° and the centerline heavy cannon 60°. Four tilting engine pods, retractable landing supports and a rear service ramp use stable engine-facing nodes.

Detailed tier: 6,428 triangles / 50 draws. Game tier: 2,424 triangles / 16 draws with one shared vertex-color material. Optional static distance tier: 1,194 triangles / one draw. Seven mechanical clips in detailed/game tiers; aiming and engine tilt remain engine-driven. Only D0 is authored. The distance tier is a parked proxy, not a moving aircraft LOD replacement.

Validated GLB structure, unique stable names, sockets, triangle hygiene, clip durations and muzzle clearance against the hull. [Open KORP](../korp/) · [Runtime contract](../assets/korp/README.md). Hand-off folder: `assets/korp/` at the commit containing this entry.

## 12 September 2026 / Collaboration contract and navigation

**Completed.** Adopted the game developer's export contract as project guidance. Plain GLB is the source of truth; upstream Meshopt copies are optional. Stable named nodes, complete damage/LOD matrices, manifests and measured budgets are part of the hand-off. The game loads distance geometry first and approaches the game tier at 150 m with hysteresis; this differs from the Solar viewer's illustrative screen-size switching.

Added shared Workshop, Devlog and Best Practices navigation to every asset viewer. The detailed contract and budget table are available in [Best Practices](../best-practices/).

## 12 September 2026 / Solar Power LOD exports

**Completed.** Four modules × four damage states × three detail levels. Original detailed files preserved. Plain and Meshopt files are supplied for each of the 48 variants.

| Intact complex | Triangles | Draw calls | Plain bytes | Meshopt bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Detailed / LOD0 | 131,236 | 1,150 | 9,203,540 | 466,996 |
| Game / LOD1 | 3,856 | 7 | 339,812 | 51,132 |
| Distance / LOD2 | 2,752 | 1 | 237,088 | 49,296 |

All 96 files passed plain/decoded loading, geometry, socket and metadata checks, including 48 damage/power combinations. Game tracking pivots remain; the distance mesh is static. These measurements are export budgets, not a phone FPS benchmark.

[Open Solar Power](../solar-power/) · [Runtime notes](../assets/solar-power/README-LODS.md). Hand-off: commit `b9dc51ad8294aa4ebe2e74d9eceeced71d401ac8`, folder `assets/solar-power/`.

## 12 September 2026 / Ammunition library

**Completed.** 18 authored ammunition families and three reused motion-lab missiles. Complete rounds, separate flight projectiles and empty cases where applicable, with game and display meshes. MÖRK Arrowhead revised to a slender rod and flared collar after reference feedback.

[Open Ammunition](../ammunition/). Hand-off: commit `b7edeb390e93f8e7999dc44a96ba53ae4f5fda46`, folder `assets/ammunition/`. Legacy references also require `assets/missile-kit/` from that commit.

## Feedback for the next hand-off

Send the module and pinned revision, the game camera used (map, third person or optic), triangles/draws/bytes as loaded, and a screenshot from that camera. Include FPS measured on the reference phone when reporting performance. Keep each request focused on one module and identify the budget it should meet.
