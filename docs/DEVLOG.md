# Devlog

Authored asset changes, game integration feedback, and work still to do. Completed entries describe exports in this repository; open requests are not completed features.

## Open requests from the game developer

1. **Terraformer 3000 and HUGIN launch pad — pending.** Create game tiers targeting 8,000 triangles, 10 draws and 400 KB plain GLB or less, plus distance tiers targeting 3,000 triangles, one draw and 250 KB. Preserve current node names so `Terraforming_Cycle` and `Cargo_Recovery_Cycle` continue to bind. The existing approximately 40k-triangle game versions exceed the new target.
2. **Robotic assembly line — pending.** Apply the same landmark budgets. The developer reports the current asset at approximately 97k triangles / 7.2 MB.
3. **SH02 rocket — pending.** Add a distance tier for the landing island as seen from the map.

The game currently uses its own derived far tiers for the first request. Those are game-side derivatives, not new authored exports in this library. The game developer's original notes are retained in [ASSET-COLLABORATION.md](../docs/ASSET-COLLABORATION.md).

## 12 September 2026 / Collaboration contract and navigation

**Completed.** Adopted the game developer's export contract as project guidance. Plain GLB is the source of truth; upstream Meshopt copies are optional. Stable named nodes, complete damage/LOD matrices, manifests and measured budgets are part of the hand-off. The game loads distance geometry first and approaches the game tier at 150 m with hysteresis; this differs from the Solar viewer's illustrative screen-size switching.

Added shared Workshop, Devlog and Best Practices navigation to every asset viewer. The detailed contract and budget table are available in [Best Practices](../best-practices/).

## 12 September 2026 / Solar Power LOD exports

**Completed.** Four modules × four damage states × three detail levels. Original detailed files preserved. Plain and Meshopt files are supplied for each of the 48 variants.

| Intact complex | Triangles | Draw calls | Plain bytes | Meshopt bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Detailed / LOD0 | 131,236 | 1,150 | 9,203,540 | 466,996 |
| Game / LOD1 | 3,856 | 7 | 339,812 | 51,132 |
| Distance / LOD2 | 2,752 | 1 | 237,088 | 49,296 |

All 96 files passed plain/decoded loading, geometry, socket and metadata checks, including 48 damage/power combinations. Game tracking pivots remain; the distance mesh is static. These measurements are export budgets, not a phone FPS benchmark.

[Open Solar Power](../solar-power/) · [Runtime notes](../assets/solar-power/README-LODS.md). Hand-off: commit `b9dc51ad8294aa4ebe2e74d9eceeced71d401ac8`, folder `assets/solar-power/`.

## 12 September 2026 / Ammunition library

**Completed.** 18 authored ammunition families and three reused motion-lab missiles. Complete rounds, separate flight projectiles and empty cases where applicable, with game and display meshes. MÖRK Arrowhead revised to a slender rod and flared collar after reference feedback.

[Open Ammunition](../ammunition/). Hand-off: commit `b7edeb390e93f8e7999dc44a96ba53ae4f5fda46`, folder `assets/ammunition/`. Legacy references also require `assets/missile-kit/` from that commit.

## Feedback for the next hand-off

Send the module and pinned revision, the game camera used (map, third person or optic), triangles/draws/bytes as loaded, and a screenshot from that camera. Include FPS measured on the reference phone when reporting performance. Keep each request focused on one module and identify the budget it should meet.
